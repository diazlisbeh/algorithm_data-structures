# Exercises _from introduction to algorithms_

[x] Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A D h31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58i.

[x] Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

[-]3. Consider the searching problem:
**Input**: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1; a2;:::;ani and a value .
**Output:** An index i such that D AÅ’i or the special value NIL if does not appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

4. Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element
   arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in 5. Analyzing algorithms 23 an .n C 1/-element array C. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for
   adding the two integers.
